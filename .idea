A scenegraph only x3dom without rendering to the Canvas
-------------------------------------------------------

x3dom constructs an x3d scenegraph object from the dom and updates it through routed events. Then it renders the scene to a webgl Canvas when there are changes. It would be useful to have a version which does not render but still parses the dom and updates the scenegraph.

This branch will try to remove rendering. It already works to just detach the render canvas from the page, so it may be quite feasible to remove it completely.

A caveat it that mouse interaction, picking and navigation will not be available but this ia unavoidable. All pickling related code will have to be short-circuited.

Strategy
--------

Just try to remove the main render call, first. Go from there.
